Great! Let's recreate the **Conversational Data Analysis Bot** using open-source libraries instead of OpenAI for processing natural language queries. We can use **Rasa NLU** for intent classification and entity extraction, **SpaCy** for more sophisticated NLP tasks, and **Pandas** for data handling. This will give us full control over the system without relying on commercial APIs.

### **Step-by-Step Guide: Open-Source Conversational Data Analysis Bot** üöÄ

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Environment**

We need to install the required libraries for our bot. We'll use:
- **Rasa NLU** for natural language understanding (intent classification and entity extraction).
- **SpaCy** for advanced NLP tasks like named entity recognition.
- **Flask** for building the web server and API endpoints.
- **Pandas** for processing CSV data.

#### Install Required Packages:

```bash
pip install rasa spacy flask pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Rasa NLU for Intent and Entity Recognition**

Rasa NLU will handle interpreting the user's intent and extracting entities (like **dates**, **products**, **sales**, etc.) from the input.

#### **Create Rasa Training Data:**

You need to create **intents** and **entities** that your bot will recognize. Save the following as `data/nlu.yml`.

```yaml
version: "2.0"
nlu:
  - intent: query_sales
    examples: |
      - What were the sales this month?
      - Show me the total sales for the last quarter
      - How much revenue did we generate last week?

  - intent: query_products
    examples: |
      - What are the top selling products?
      - Show me the top 5 products by revenue
      - List the best performing products

  - intent: query_avg_sales
    examples: |
      - What is the average sales?
      - Show me the average sales for the month
      - What's the average revenue per customer?

  - intent: query_sales_trends
    examples: |
      - Show me the sales trends over time
      - What is the sales pattern over the last year?
```

#### **Create a Domain File:**

The domain file defines the intents and entities the bot can recognize, as well as any responses it can give. Save it as `domain.yml`.

```yaml
version: "2.0"
intents:
  - query_sales
  - query_products
  - query_avg_sales
  - query_sales_trends

entities:
  - product
  - date

responses:
  utter_sales_query:
    - text: "I found the sales data you're looking for."
  utter_products_query:
    - text: "Here are the top selling products."
  utter_avg_sales_query:
    - text: "Here is the average sales information."
  utter_sales_trends_query:
    - text: "I can show you the sales trends over time."

actions:
  - action_query_sales
  - action_query_products
  - action_query_avg_sales
  - action_query_sales_trends
```

#### **Set Up the Action Server (Python)**

For each intent, you will need to create a custom action to process the query. For example, the `action_query_sales` action will process a user's query about sales.

Create a file `actions.py`:

```python
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
import pandas as pd
import datetime

class ActionQuerySales(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_query_sales"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        # Load your CSV data
        df = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

        # Example logic: filter by month or date range
        today = datetime.date.today()
        last_month = today.replace(day=1) - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

        monthly_sales = df[df['date'].dt.month == last_month.month]['sales'].sum()

        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Total sales for last month: {monthly_sales}")
        return []

class ActionQueryProducts(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_query_products"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        df = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")
        top_products = df.groupby('product')['sales'].sum().nlargest(5)
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Top 5 products by sales: {top_products}")
        return []

class ActionQueryAvgSales(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_query_avg_sales"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        df = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")
        avg_sales = df['sales'].mean()
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Average sales: {avg_sales}")
        return []

class ActionQuerySalesTrends(Action):
    def name(self):
        return "action_query_sales_trends"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        df = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")
        monthly_sales_trends = df.groupby(df['date'].dt.to_period('M'))['sales'].sum()
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Sales trends over time: {monthly_sales_trends}")
        return []
```

#### **Train and Run Rasa NLU**:

Train your Rasa model using:

```bash
rasa train
```

After training, run the action server:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

And start the Rasa NLU server:

```bash
rasa shell
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Flask API to Handle File Uploads and Queries**

Now, we'll use **Flask** to handle CSV file uploads and interaction with the Rasa bot.

#### **Flask Application (app.py):**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pandas as pd
from rasa.core.agent import Agent
from rasa.core.interpreter import RasaNLUInterpreter

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load Rasa agent for processing user input
interpreter = RasaNLUInterpreter("models/nlu")
agent = Agent.load("models/dialogue", interpreter=interpreter)

df = None

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Conversational Data Analysis Bot!"

# Endpoint to upload CSV and process data
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    global df
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    return jsonify({"message": "CSV uploaded successfully. You can now ask questions!"})

# Endpoint to interact with the bot
@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    if df is None:
        return jsonify({"error": "No data uploaded. Please upload a CSV file first."})

    user_input = request.json['message']
    response = process_query(user_input)
    return jsonify({"response": response})

def process_query(user_input):
    # Process the query with Rasa
    responses = agent.handle_text(user_input)
    return responses[0]['text']

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your Flask Application**

To start the application, simply run the following:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your Flask app will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Interact with the Bot**

#### Step 1: Upload the CSV File  
Use **Postman** or **curl** to upload your CSV.

**Using curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@your_data.csv" http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload
```

#### Step 2: Ask Questions  
After uploading the CSV, send a **POST request** to `/ask` with a **message** (in JSON format).

**Using curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "What were the sales this month?"}'
```

#### Step 3: Receive the Response  
You‚Äôll get a response like:

```json
{
  "response": "Total sales for last month: 15000"
}
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion**

This is a basic **open-source conversational data analysis bot** that:
- Uses **Rasa NLU** to process natural language queries.
- Uses **Pandas** to process and analyze the uploaded CSV data.
- Uses **Flask** to serve as the API that handles file uploads and query processing.

You can extend the bot to:
- Handle more complex queries.
- Add visualization capabilities (e.g., using **Matplotlib** or **Plotly**).
- Support more advanced NLP features.

Would you like to expand any specific part of the bot, or do you need further assistance with the code?
